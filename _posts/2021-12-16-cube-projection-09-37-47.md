description:
  This image view could represent a 2D sketeton cube "shadow" (If it was all black.) 
  I am not suggesting that the 4D hypercube has co-incident nodes only that,  
  analogous to this view as a shadow of the 3D cube, in this vZome model where its yellow and
  red nodes appear co-incident the nodes may appear co-incident in the 3D shadow model of the hypercube.
