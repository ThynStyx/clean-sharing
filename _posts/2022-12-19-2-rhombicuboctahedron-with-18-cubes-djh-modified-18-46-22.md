    √2 rhombicuboctahedron with 18 cubes
 </figcaption>   
</figure>  

Two of the nine mirrored pairs of embedded cubes are shown along with all of the balls and struts that form the other cubes.
All struts are the same length.
Outer vertices are (±1, ±1, ±(1 + √2)) as shown on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombicuboctahedron#Cartesian_coordinates).
2D Shadows and Coloured 3D hull are of the model enlarged for clarity.
