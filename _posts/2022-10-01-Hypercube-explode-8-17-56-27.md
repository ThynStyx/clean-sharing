I created this skeletal hypercube at (0, 0, 0) and then exploded its unit cube projections in the other dimensions to show what would be projections of UNIT cube representations in their appropriate fields. As with all 4D hypercube representations of this form each UNIT cube exhibits a required scaling / distortion in the alternate dimensions so that their 3D projections may be viewed.  If they were not scaled / obliquely projected then all eight unit cubes would fold a multi-dimensional 8 cube Tesseract net into the a single unit cube in multidimensional space comprised of 8 superimposed  identical unit cubes.
